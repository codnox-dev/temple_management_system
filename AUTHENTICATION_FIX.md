# Authentication Protection Fix

## Problem
The admin panel was accessible without authentication. Users could navigate to `/admin` and other admin routes without logging in via OTP, exposing protected routes and data.

## Root Cause
1. The `enhancedJwtAuth` service was calling `getInitialToken()` on app initialization, which provided an anonymous/unauthenticated token
2. The `isAuthenticated()` method only checked if a token existed, without distinguishing between authenticated user tokens and anonymous tokens
3. Session storage persisted tokens without tracking authentication state

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced JWT Authentication Service (`enhancedJwtAuth.ts`)
- **Added `isUserAuthenticated` flag**: Tracks whether the user is actually logged in (not just having an anonymous token)
- **Updated `setTokens()` method**: Now accepts an `isAuthenticated` parameter to distinguish between:
  - Anonymous tokens (from `getInitialToken()`) - marked as `isAuthenticated: false`
  - User tokens (from OTP verification) - marked as `isAuthenticated: true`
- **Updated `isAuthenticated()` check**: Now requires both token validity AND the `isUserAuthenticated` flag to be true
- **Session storage enhancement**: Stores the authentication state in `sessionStorage.setItem('is_authenticated', ...)`
- **Token loading**: Reads authentication state from session storage on page reload
- **Logout cleanup**: Clears the `isUserAuthenticated` flag on logout

### 2. Authentication Context (`AuthContext.tsx`)
- **Removed `getInitialToken()` call**: No longer requests anonymous tokens on app initialization
- **Session expiration handling**: Added listeners for `session-expired` and `logout` events
- **Automatic redirect**: Redirects to `/login` when session expires with a toast notification
- **Better error handling**: Clears authentication state if user verification fails

### 3. Protected Route Component (`ProtectedRoute.tsx`)
- **Added loading state**: Shows a loading spinner while checking authentication
- **Improved UX**: Prevents flash of content before redirect
- **Redirect to login**: Automatically redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`

### 4. API Interceptor (`api.ts`)
- **Enhanced 401 handling**: Detects unauthorized access to admin endpoints
- **Automatic logout**: Clears session and redirects to login on 401 errors
- **Protected endpoint detection**: Identifies admin-specific routes for stricter handling

## Authentication Flow

### Before Fix:
```
1. App loads → getInitialToken() → Anonymous token stored
2. isAuthenticated() → true (because token exists)
3. User navigates to /admin → Allowed (token exists)
4. Backend rejects API calls → 401 error
```

### After Fix:
```
1. App loads → Check sessionStorage for authenticated token
2. If no auth token → isAuthenticated() → false
3. User navigates to /admin → ProtectedRoute blocks → Redirect to /login
4. User enters mobile number → Sends OTP
5. User enters OTP → verifyOTP() → Token marked as authenticated
6. isAuthenticated() → true (token exists AND isUserAuthenticated = true)
7. User can access /admin → API calls succeed
```

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Authentication Protection
- [ ] Cannot access `/admin` without logging in
- [ ] Cannot access `/admin/rituals` without logging in
- [ ] Cannot access `/admin/events` without logging in
- [ ] Cannot access `/admin/bookings` without logging in
- [ ] Cannot access `/admin/stock/add` without logging in
- [ ] Redirected to `/login` when accessing protected routes

### ✅ Login Flow
- [ ] Can send OTP to mobile number
- [ ] Can verify OTP and get authenticated
- [ ] Redirected to appropriate admin page based on role after login
- [ ] Token persists on page refresh
- [ ] Session expires after token expiry time

### ✅ Logout Flow
- [ ] Logout clears authentication state
- [ ] Logout redirects to `/login`
- [ ] Cannot access admin routes after logout
- [ ] Must login again to access admin panel

### ✅ Session Management
- [ ] Session expiration shows toast notification
- [ ] Automatically redirected to login on session expiry
- [ ] 401 errors from API trigger automatic logout
- [ ] Loading spinner shows while checking authentication

## Security Improvements

1. **No Anonymous Access**: Admin routes now require authenticated user tokens
2. **Session Tracking**: Clear distinction between authenticated and anonymous sessions
3. **Automatic Session Cleanup**: Expired sessions are automatically cleared
4. **Enhanced 401 Handling**: API errors trigger proper logout flow
5. **Protected Route Guard**: Component-level protection prevents unauthorized access

## Files Modified

1. `frontend/src/lib/enhancedJwtAuth.ts` - Core authentication service
2. `frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Authentication context provider
3. `frontend/src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx` - Route protection component
4. `frontend/src/api/api.ts` - API interceptor for 401 handling

## No Backend Changes Required

All changes are frontend-only. The backend authentication endpoints remain unchanged and continue to work as expected.

## Deployment Notes

1. Clear browser cache and session storage after deployment
2. Test login flow thoroughly in production
3. Monitor for any 401 errors in application logs
4. Verify session expiration behavior matches expected timeout
