# ✅ VIDEO NOW PLAYS ON EVERY REFRESH

## Changes Made (October 19, 2025)

### What Changed:
The video intro now plays **on every page load and refresh**, not just once per session.

### Modified Files:
1. ✅ `frontend/src/components/VideoIntro.tsx`
   - Removed `sessionStorage.getItem('hasWatchedIntroVideo')` check
   - Removed `sessionStorage.setItem('hasWatchedIntroVideo', 'true')`
   - Video now plays fresh on every visit

2. ✅ `VIDEO_INTRO_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
   - Updated documentation to reflect new behavior
   - Added recommendations for short videos
   - Added optional "Don't show again" feature code

## New Behavior:

### Every Time You:
- Open the website ✅ Video plays
- Refresh the page ✅ Video plays
- Navigate back to homepage ✅ Video plays
- Open in new tab ✅ Video plays

### User Can:
- ⏭️ Skip video anytime with "Skip Intro" button (top-right)
- ⏸️ Video auto-plays and transitions to door after completion

## Important Recommendations:

### ⚠️ Keep Video Short & Optimized!
Since the video plays every time:

**Ideal Specs:**
- Duration: 10-15 seconds
- File Size: Under 10 MB
- Resolution: 720p (1280×720)
- Bitrate: 1-3 Mbps
- Format: H.264 MP4

**Why?**
- Users will see it repeatedly
- Bandwidth usage on every visit
- Faster loading = better experience

### Optional Enhancement:
Consider adding a "Don't show this again" checkbox if users find it repetitive. Code sample is in the main documentation.

## Test It:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Then:
1. Open http://localhost:5173 → Video plays ✅
2. Refresh page → Video plays again ✅
3. Click "Skip Intro" → Goes to door ✅
4. Refresh again → Video plays again ✅

## Performance Notes:

✅ **Good:**
- Native HTML5 video (fast)
- Component removes itself after playing
- Browser may cache video after first load

⚠️ **Consider:**
- Video downloads on every visit (bandwidth)
- May become repetitive for frequent visitors
- Keep file size small for mobile users

## Quick Comparison:

| Behavior | Before | Now |
|----------|--------|-----|
| First visit | ✅ Plays | ✅ Plays |
| Page refresh | ❌ Skipped | ✅ Plays |
| New tab | ✅ Plays | ✅ Plays |
| After closing browser | ✅ Plays | ✅ Plays |

## Need to Revert?

If you want it to play only once per session again, see the "Customization Options" section in `VIDEO_INTRO_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for the code to add back.
